        <h2>Overflow: visible</h2>

        <p>By default, the overflow is visible, meaning that it is not clipped and it
            renders outside the element's box:</p>

        <div class="a">You can use the overflow property when you want to have better
            control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content
            overflows an element's box.</div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Overflow: hidden</h2>

        <p>With the hidden value, the overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content
            is hidden:</p>
        <p>Try to remove the overflow property to understand how it works.</p>

        <div class="b">You can use the overflow property when you want to have better
            control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content
            overflows an element's box.</div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Overflow: scroll</h2>

        <p>Setting the overflow value to scroll, the overflow is clipped and a scrollbar
            is added to scroll inside the box. Note that this will add a scrollbar both
            horizontally and vertically (even if you do not need it):</p>

        <div class="c">You can use the overflow property when you want to have better
            control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content
            overflows an element's box.</div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Overflow: auto</h2>

        <p>The auto value is similar to scroll, only it add scrollbars when necessary:</p>

        <div class="d">You can use the overflow property when you want to have better
            control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content
            overflows an element's box.</div>

        <h2>Overflow-x and overflow-y</h2>

        <p>You can also change the overflow of content horizontally or vertically.</p>
        <p>overflow-x specifies what to do with the left/right edges of the content.</p>
        <p>overflow-y specifies what to do with the top/bottom edges of the content.</p>

        <div class="e">You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of
            the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an
            element's box.</div>
